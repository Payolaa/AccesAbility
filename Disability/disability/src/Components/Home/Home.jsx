            A disability is a condition that limits us partially or completely, depending on the type of disability. Around 1.3 billion people experience significant disabilities, making up about 1 in 6 people globally. People with disabilities may die up to 20 years earlier, have a higher risk of additional health issues, and face discrimination and limited accessibility.
